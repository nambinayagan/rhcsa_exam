Practised using AWS [EC2 + EBS]
Had to install LVM in EC2 instance using >> yum install lvm2
Created a new EBS volume
Partioned it into 3 partitions using fdisk >> we can use "fdisk -l" and lsblk for more details info about available disks
Usage of fdisk
  fdisk /dev/xvdf3
      n >> new
      p >> primary
      .
      .
      t >> to change the partition type to LVM >> Hex is 8e
      w >> to save
Now the disk has been partitioned
Now create a physical volume for all the partions which needs to be added in volumegroup >> pvcreate <partion name>
Now create volume group which combines the physical volumes >> vgcreate <vgname> <pvname> . . .
Now create logical volume with required amount of disk space >> lvcreate -L <disk_space> -n <lv_name> <vgname>
Now create filesystem in the logical volume before mounting it
  For xfs filesystem >> mkfs.xfs <lv_name>
  For ext2,ext3,ext4 filesystem >> mkfs.ext4 <lv_name>
Now as the filesystem is created, we have to create the directory where we have to mount the volume >> mkdir /mountpoint
Now mount the volume >> mount <lv_name> /mountpoint
Now in order to make the mount persistent we have to add the details in /etc/fstab
  vi /etc/fstab
    Using lv_name 
        <lv_name> /mountpoint <fstype eg:ext4> defaults 0 0
    Using UUID
        Find UUID using >> blkid
        <UUID> /mountpoint <fstype eg:ext4> defaults 0 0  
To mount all in /etc/fstab >> mount -a
Now verify using df -h
