Practised using AWS [EC2 + EBS]
Had to install LVM in EC2 instance using >> yum install lvm2
Created a new EBS volume
Partioned it into 3 partitions using fdisk >> we can use "fdisk -l" and lsblk for more details info about available disks
Usage of fdisk
  fdisk /dev/xvdf3
      n >> new
      p >> primary
      .
      .
      t >> to change the partition type to LVM >> Hex is 8e
      w >> to save
Now the disk has been partitioned
Now create a physical volume for all the partions which needs to be added in volumegroup >> pvcreate <partion name>
Now create volume group which combines the physical volumes
    If physical extent is default >> vgcreate <vgname> <pvname> . . .
    If physical extent is defained as X >> vgcreate -s XM <vgname> <pvname> . . .
Now create logical volume with required amount of disk space >> lvcreate -L <disk_space> -n <lv_name> <vgname>
                                                                lvcreate -l <No_of_PE> -n <lv_name> <vgname>                   Here the total size="No_of_PE" x PE
Now create filesystem in the logical volume before mounting it
  For xfs filesystem >> mkfs.xfs <lv_name>
  For ext2,ext3,ext4 filesystem >> mkfs.ext4 <lv_name>
Now as the filesystem is created, we have to create the directory where we have to mount the volume >> mkdir /mountpoint
Now mount the volume >> mount <lv_name> /mountpoint
Now in order to make the mount persistent we have to add the details in /etc/fstab
  vi /etc/fstab
    Using lv_name 
        <lv_name> /mountpoint <fstype eg:ext4> defaults 0 0
    Using UUID
        Find UUID using >> blkid
        <UUID="UUID_value"> /mountpoint <fstype eg:ext4> defaults 0 0  
To mount all in /etc/fstab >> mount -a
Now verify using df -h
We can use df -hT to get the filesystem associated with that logical volume.



============================LVM Extend=================================
Now if we have to extend a logical volume we first have to check is the required value present in the volume group
    If the space is available then
        lvextend -L +<disk_space> -n <lv_name> <vgname>
    If the required disk space is not available then add  anew physical volume to the volumegroup
        If there is no physical volume available then Follow line 5 to line 14 to create physical volumes (from fdisk  to pvcreate)
        Now extend the volumegroup with newly created physical volume using >> vgextend <vgname> <pvname>
        Now extend the logical volume using lvextend -L +<disk_space> -n <lv_name> <vgname>
        Even though the LV is extended this change wont reflect in df -hT. Hence we have to resize the File system
        If filesystem is XFS
            run command: xfs_growfs <lv_name>
        If filesystem is Ext?
            run command: resize2fs <lv_name>
        Now the extended volume should reflect while using df -hT

============================LVM Extend Completed=================================


============================LVM Reduce=================================
For EXT fs:

First unmount the logical volume >> umount /mountpoint
Perform fsck on the logical volume >> e2fsck <lv_name>
Reduce the size of filesystem to desired space >> resize2fs <lv_name> <disk_space>
Now reduce the size of logical volume >> lvreduce -L <disk_space> -n <lv_name>
Now we can do fsck but it is not a compulsary step
Now mount the logical volume to the mountpoint

For XFS fs:

For install xfsdump >> yum install xfsdump -y
Now Backup The Data >> xfsdump -f /mountpoint   /backupdir
Now unmount the partition
Now reduce the logical volume >> lvreduce -L <disk_space> -n <lv_name>
Now again format the partition with xfs >> mkfs.xfs <lv_name>
Now mount the logical volume to mountpoint >> mount <lv_name> /mountpoint
Now restore the backup >> xfsrestore -f /backupdir /mountpoint

============================LVM Reduce Completed=================================



============================LVM Delete=================================
Unmount the logical volume
Disable Logical volume    lvchange -an <lv_name>
Remove Logical volume     lvremove <lv_name>
Disable Volume group      vgchange -an <vgname>
Remove Volume group       vgremove <vgname>
Remove Physical volume    pvremove <pvname1> <pvname2> ..
