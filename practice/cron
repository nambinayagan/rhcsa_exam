crontab command
crontab -l                                                              #To list the active crons
crontab -e                                                              #To create a new cron


Running  cron jobs can be allowed or disallowed for different users.  For this purpose, use the cron.allow and cron.deny files.  If the cron.allow file exists, a user must be listed in it to be allowed to use cron If the cron.allow file does not exist but the cron.deny file does exist, then a user must not be listed in the cron.deny file in order to use cron.  If neither of these files exists, only the super user is allowed to use cron.


Cron related files/directories
=======


Cron created files/directories

===========
/etc/cron.deny				#Add name of user for which cron functionality is disabled
/etc/crontab				#We can schedule recurring task in this file and in this we have to add details just like crontab -e
					#Has format of cron (Minute:Hour:Day:Month:Week:User:Command)
					eg: Cron to run every 5 minutes: */5 * * * * nambi echo hello >> hellofile.txt

/etc/cron.d/<anyfilename>		#Here we can add details in <anyfilename> just like /etc/crontab file 
					But one advantage of adding file under cron.d instead of /etc/crontab is that when we update crontab the contents inside /etc/crontab is wiped but the data inside /etc/cron.d/<anyfilename> is retained


These are directories and we can add scripts inside them so that the script gets executed daily/hourly/weekly/monthly
/etc/cron.daily  >> /etc/cron.daily/<myscript.sh>	#here myscript.sh will run daily once
/etc/cron.hourly >> /etc/cron.hourly/<myscript.sh>	#here myscript.sh will run hourly once
/etc/cron.monthly >> /etc/cron.monthly/<myscript.sh>	#here myscript.sh will run monthly once
/etc/cron.weekly >> /etc/cron.weekly/<myscript.sh>	#here myscript.sh will run weekly once
