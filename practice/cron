Cron Scheduling in RHEL8

at command

at					#To add jobs which needs to be run once
atq					#To list user's pending job
atrm					#To delete jobs depending on Job ID.
batch					#executes commands when system  load  levels  permit


Cron created files/directories
===========
/etc/cron.deny				#Add name of user for which cron functionality is disabled
/etc/crontab				#Has format of cron (Minute:Hour:Day:Month:Week:User:Command)
					eg: Cron to run every 5 minutes: */5 * * * * nambi echo hello >> hellofile.txt


These are directories and we can add scripts inside them so that the script gets executed daily/hourly/weekly/monthly
/etc/cron.d
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.hourly
/etc/cron.monthly
/etc/cron.weekly

==========


crontab -l								#To list the active crons
crontab -e								#To create a new cron
